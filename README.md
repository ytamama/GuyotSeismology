# GuyotSeismology

Programs to analyse seismological data, such as those of campus construction, at Guyot Hall, Princeton University. Seismic data were collected using a Nanometrics Meridian Compact PH 120 seismometer. Weather data were collected using a Vaisala WXT530 weather station, also stationed at Guyot Hall. This weather station is used in conjunction with a Septentrio PolaRx5 receiver. 

I wish to thank the IRIS Seismology Skill Building Workshop in Summer 2020, of the IRIS Education and 
Public Outreach Program, for their helpful tutorials on scientific computing. In addition, the 
facilities of IRIS Data Services, and specifically the IRIS Data Management Center, were used for access to earthquake catalog information, computing the distances and travel times from those earthquakes to Guyot Hall, and accessing software including Seismic Analysis Code (SAC) and evalresp. The facilities of the IRIS Consortium and IRIS Data Services are funded through the Seismological Facilities for the Advancement of Geoscience (SAGE) Award of the National Science Foundation under Cooperative Support Agreement EAR-1851048.
